# Employee Turnover Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee turnover trends in a company using a rich dataset from Kaggle. We aim to identify key factors influencing employee departure and develop predictive models to forecast turnover, which can support HR departments in making informed retention strategies.

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   We imported and cleaned the employee dataset using RStudio, transforming categorical and numerical variables to ensure accurate analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   We visualized relationships between variables such as age, education, and salary, analyzing their impact on employee decisions to leave or stay.

3. **Predictive Modeling**

   - **Linear and Logistic Regression**: These methods were used to analyze how various factors (age, education, etc.) influence employee turnover probabilities.
   - **Random Forest and XGBoost**: We built and compared these models to predict employee turnover with high accuracy. XGBoost performed slightly better with an accuracy of 86%.

4. **Conclusion**  
   Our analysis identified key factors like **Joining Year** and **Education** as strong predictors of employee turnover. The models achieved accuracy rates of 85-86%, providing valuable insights for predicting employee retention.

## Technologies Used:

- **RStudio**: Data cleaning, visualization, and model building.
- **Random Forest, XGBoost**: Machine learning models to predict employee turnover.
